One less decision to make. That's what comes to mind when
I saw [the picture of Zuck's clothes](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10102616790362931&set=a.529237706231.2034669.4&type=3).
With that kind of clothes setup, there won't be any confusion on what to wear every morning.
He probably just wakes up, takes a bath, and grabs any t-shirt there. Quick and easy.

Options are always good. Options are liberating. Options open to many possibilities.
But sometimes, options are overwhelming.
Sometimes, options are distracting. Sometimes, less options is better.
Sometimes, just pick whatever there's to pick is nice. And relaxing.

I've been trying to reduce options in my life  in order to keep my focus to things I actually want to do.
This has been the one of the bases of why I choose what I choose.
