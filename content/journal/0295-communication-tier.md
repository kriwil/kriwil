Title: Communication Tier

There are many ways you could contact people these days. Email, text, instant
messenger, phone call, randomly call people in the middle of busy street.
You name it. If you're updated enough (and by that I mean using internet), I believe
you could be contacted using at least two of those I mentioned above.

But, how do we prioritize it? Surely contacting someone that you're having a baby
won't be the same as contacting someone that you're cat is having a baby. I have
some kind of communication tier that prioritize the ways you could contact me.

So here's it, ordered from least urgent, to most urgent:

0. twitter  
I don't check twitter regularly. Sometimes it could be couple a day, another time
I check like once in two days. If you want really want my response, I won't suggest
you contact me using this channel. DM might work as it will send email,
but I don't always get DM emails, so don't rely to much on it.

1. email  
I only check my email 2-3 times a day. If you could wait 1-2 days before you get
any response from me, email is the best way. I will always try to reply emails,
so if I haven't replied you email in 3 days, you could resend it just fine.

2. whatsapp/skype/hangout  
I use them because everybody's using them, so I generally available on those platforms.
I don't turn any notification on my phone though. I will usually response
in few hours, depending on how often I check my phone. If you think you could wait
up to 12 hours, go ahead.

3. [telegram][]  
I love this service because it's fast and it has clients in many platforms. If I'm
not busy, I will response immediately, otherwise, it'll be couple hours if I'm
_in the zone_. And I have the notification turned on for this app, because I only
communicate with 5 people in this app, so it's not many.

4. text/imessage  
This one actually stands on the same level with telegram, but if you could send
me text with blue bubble, feel free to send it using this instead of telegram.

5. phone call  
Please only use this if you want my response at that time. I answer calls most of the
time (if I'm not on meeting), so please don't call for something I won't accept,
like credit card offer or something like that. You'll go to blocked list instantly
if you do that.

I'm not suggesting I'm so busy that you should contact me accordingly. The fact is
I'm not busy at all. I'm working from home, so I could finish my daily job and
have a lot of free time. I'm just showing that I have reason why I haven't replied
your emails or messages. Sending 2 emails in the range of 1 hour because I haven't
replied it yet won't help.
