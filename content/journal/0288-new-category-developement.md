Title: New category, development

In case you haven't noticed, I have new category for this blog: [development](/development/).

This category (hopefully) will be a place for me to talk about development. Mostly will be about
web development (since that's what I do), and some tought about software development in general.

So, let's see how far it'll go.

Oh one more thing. I'll probably use English and Bahasa Indonesia. Not in the same post though.
But sometimes I'll write in English, sometimes I'll write in Bahasa Indonesia. Depends on my mood, and the topic itself.
Basically just like the [other category](/journal/).
