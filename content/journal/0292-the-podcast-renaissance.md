Podcast is back! Well sort of. It never went away anyway. But sure it gets more
popular.

So, what is podcast? Quoting [wikipedia][podcastwikipedia]:

> A podcast is a digital medium that consists of an episodic series of audio,
> video, digital radio, PDF, or ePub files subscribed to and downloaded through
> web syndication or streamed on-line to a computer or mobile device.

I often use _audio blog_ or _video blog_ to explain what podcast is. After all,
people know what blog is.

I won't tell you about the history of podcast.
I don't know when the first podcast was released, or which the first podcast is.
I'm not interested in learning that history. You should be able to google your way
to find those information.

I'm here to tell you that you should listen to podcast. Especially if you're
commuting. Especially if you're commuting for hours. Reading books is one of
way to spend your commmuting time. But what if you're driving? I won't suggest
reading books if you're driving your own vehicle. I might as well ask you to
jump out of a cliff. So, listen to podcast instead.

What should you listen? For a start, try [Hello Internet][hifm] and [Serial][serialpodcast].

Hello Internet a generic tech/random stuff podcast,
hosted by [CGP Grey][cgpgrey] and [Brady Haran][bradyharan]. You'll enjoy it.

Serial is probably the most popular podcast in 2014. Before serial, podcast is
probably listened only by internet geeks. But now it reaches more people.
This is why Myke Hurley of [Relay FM][relayfm] called it a podcast rennaissance
in is talk, ["How I became an Independent Podcaster"][hibaip]. It is indeed
the perfect time for you to start listen to podcast.

These are some podcasts I'm currently subcribing, in no particular order,
excluding the two I mentioned above:

- [Accidental Tech Podcast][atpfm]
- [The Talk Show][thetalkshow]
- All [Relay FM][relayfm] podcasts. except Pen Addict, because, well it's a podcast about pen.
- [This Week in Google](http://twit.tv/show/this-week-in-google)
- [The Incomparable](https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/)
- This is Only a Test and Still Untitled from [tested.com](http://www.tested.com/podcast/)
- [The Web Ahead](http://thewebahead.net/)
