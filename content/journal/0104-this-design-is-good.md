I'll stick with this default design for a while. I don't have any inspiration right now. Well, actually I do have some ideas, but I just don't have time (hint: lazy) to put it in codes. I'm afraid the design will be very bad (as if I ever did good ones) if I create on lazy mood.

But I *might* do something about the design. I don't know. I really want to change the design.

Whatever. Content is the most important thing, nuff said. But what is this? Standard design with no content at all. Well, enjoy your day.
