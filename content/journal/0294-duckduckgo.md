I've been using [DuckDuckGo][ddg] as my main search engine for over 3 months now.
I replaced the default search engine both in my phone and my computer.
I thought it's time for me to write something about it.

I don't have any specific reason other than one day I was unreasonably creeped
out by Google because it showed my receipt in the search result. Obivously I
knew the search result was crafted for my personal use, and the data wasn't
publicly available and I shouldn't worry about it. But still, I finally had
a reason to try DuckDuckGo.

Overall, I don't think I missed anything. I always find what I am looking for.
I never compared the result with Google, so I don't even know whether the result
is better or worse. The fact that I mostly search about technical stuff helps
too I guess.
