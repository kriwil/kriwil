Thanks to some [dude](http://kecebongsoft.com/2016/07/im-building-a-pc.html), I remember I need to
post an update for my [PC build](mypcbuild).

Since that post, I've gradually uppgrade some parts of the PC. I've increased the RAM to 12GB
(8GB + 4GB RAM &mdash; now I have one 4GB RAM stick lying around. Want to buy? email me!).
I also add Samsung EVO 250GB SSD (for OS) and 500GB Seagate drive (for backup). Somehow The water
cooling system suddenly stopped working so I had it replaced with original heat sink, but I
replaced the fan with [Noctua NH L9I](noctua) to keep it silent. I also added [APC Pro 550](ups) for
UPS because electricity in Indonesia isn't that good.

One think I regret from the build was the small case. I should've bought bigger one since now I
don't have many GPU choices to go with the case. I don't have any plan to upgrade it now, but
it'll be nice to have options for VR-ready GPU at somepoint in the future.
