If you want to survive in Jakarta, you have to work remotely. Especially if your company is in IT. There are only few position that can't be done remotely. Probably. My point is, if you should work remotely. Your time is very valuable.

4 hours wasted on the road is more than 4 hours productivity being taken away. To work well, you need a clear mind. And there's no way you could have clear mind if you spend 4 hours in one single trip. Just imagine the things you could do in 4 hours. That's half day of your daily work.

_It's time to revisit my plan. It doesn't work._
