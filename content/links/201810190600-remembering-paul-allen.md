> Paul foresaw that computers would change the world.
> Even in high school, before any of us knew what a personal computer was,
> he was predicting that computer chips would get super-powerful
> and would eventually give rise to a whole new industry.
> That insight of his was the cornerstone of everything we did together.

> Paul deserved more time in life. He would have made the most of it. I will miss him tremendously.
