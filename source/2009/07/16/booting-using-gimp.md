## booting using gimp?

> I had ubuntu installed and i installed windows inside it. How do I uninstall ubuntu without reinstalling windows? It is booting using gimp if that?s any help.

[Centerarticles](http://www.centerarticles.com/how-do-i-uninstall-ubuntu-while-windows-is-installed-within-it/). I'll be glad to know how image editor could boot OS.
