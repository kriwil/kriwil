### Simplicity Rules

I always love simplicity and usability. I prefer [gnome](http://gnome.org) over [KDE](http://kde.org) for simplicity reason ... and sentimental reason :P I'm a big gnome fans since gnome 1.4 :D
I use [epiphany](http://www.gnome.org/projects/epiphany/ as my main browser. [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/ is used when I need to check my web design using [Web Developer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60 addons.

So, when it comes to opitimize my desktop, simplicity and usability are my main concerns. I use [Avant Window Navigator](https://launchpad.net/awn to manage my applications I'm using. This kind of dock is one of things I like from OSX. I use simple but beautiful wallpaper. I remove icons from my menubar, so it only has text in it.

Enough talking, I have to go. Enjoy my desktop screenshot, and have a nice day.
