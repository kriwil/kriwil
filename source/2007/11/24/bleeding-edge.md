### Bleeding Edge

Now I'm using bleeding edge textpattern from its subversion. It's the [4.0.x development branch](http://svn.textpattern.com/development/4.0/). I was planning to use [4.1/crockery branch](http://svn.textpattern.com/development/crockery/), but I haven't tested a lot, so I didn't know how good it is for live usage. So, the 4.1 stays in localhost.

So, since this is from svn, there will be bugs here and there. Please let me know if you find any. Thank you :)
