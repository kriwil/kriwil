### 2012

And it's 2012 already. Life's fast, isn't it? Resolutions? Nope. Don't I have them. Oh wait, I have them. Won't share though.

2011 was a great year. Some reasons, use python profesionally and working abroad. Other small things: relearn c++/qt/qml for symbian development, released (two) free apps to the nokia store, have two webapps in the net (though I haven't promote them, yet).

2012, I'll still use python, it's my main language now. Maybe I'll write more mobile apps, for fun. Another plan is to spend more time in my webapps. And more vacations.

More surprise to come. Hopefully.

So, what's yours?
