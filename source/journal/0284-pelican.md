And I [changed the blog engine](http://kriwil.com/journal/gonta-ganti-blog-engine/). Again. Now, the lucky one is [pelican](http://pelican.notmyidea.org). Why? Because maintaining codes is hard. Really hard. It's much easier to use the available ones. And maybe I could contribute something there. Who knows.

So, pelican. It's python, it's simple, it generates static. Love it. So I could focus to thing that matters, blogging. But it doesn't mean that I'll blog more tough. It's just nice to have simple tools around me.
