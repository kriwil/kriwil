Title: Git of Bazaar?
Date: 2007-12-16 04:02:19
Slug: git-of-bazaar

Which one should I use? "Git":http://git.or.cz/ or "Bazaar":http://bazaar-vcs.org/? I've tried Git, and it's great distributed SCM tool, but Bazaar is temping because the fact that I could (possibly) publish my repository to ftp server. I'll give it a try.
