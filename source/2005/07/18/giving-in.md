## Giving In

Nothing really important here. In fact, it's not important at all.  
Just want to post a lyric from a song that I heard most lately.  
It's an old song from [Adema](http://www.ademaonline.com/), called **Giving In**.


>*Will you, walk me  
>To the edge again  
>Shaking, lonely, and I am drinking again  
>Woke up tonight and no one's here with me  
>I'm giving in to you*
>
>*Take me under  
>I'm giving in to you  
>I'm dying tonight  
>I'm giving in to you  
>Watch me crumble  
>I'm giving in to you  
>I'm crying tonight  
>I'm giving in to you*
>
>*Caught up, in life  
>Losing all my friends  
>Family has tried, to heal all my addictions  
>Tragic it seems, to be alone again  
>I'm giving in to you*
>
>*Take me under  
>I'm giving in to you  
>I'm dying tonight  
>I'm giving in to you  
>Watch me crumble  
>I'm giving in to you  
>I'm crying tonight  
>I'm giving in to you*
>
>*I look forward, to dying tonight  
>Drinks still on myself, life's harder every day  
>The stress has got me  
>I'm giving in  
>Giving  
>Giving in now!*
>
>*Take me under  
>(I'm killing all the faith)  
>I'm dying tonight  
>(I'm sick of all that faith)  
>Watch me crumble  
>(I'm killing all the faith)  
>I'm crying tonight*
>
>*I'm giving in to you  
>Take me under  
>I'm giving in to you  
>I'm dying tonight  
>I'm giving in to you  
>Watch me crumble  
>I'm giving in to you  
>I'm crying tonight  
>I'm giving in to you  
>Take me under  
>I'm giving in to you  
>I'm dying tonight  
>I'm giving in to you*
