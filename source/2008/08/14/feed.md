## Feed

What's worse than a website that has no [feed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_feed)? A website using summary feed. Full content feed, or no feed at all. Please. 

Having to click every content to read the full story is destroying the purpose of using feed reader. Let the readers decide whether they want to read it or not. Of course if the purpose is ad impression that would be a totally different story.
